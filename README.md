Working on this project helped me refine my skills in responsive design and CSS styling. Here are a few highlights:

```html

<!-- Example HTML code -->
<div class="qr-code">
  <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code">
  <h4>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h4>
  <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
</div>
```
```css

/* Example CSS code */
.qr-code {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); /* White background */
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  width: 100%; /* Full width of its container */
  max-width: 200px; /* Restrict maximum width */
}
```
